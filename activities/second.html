    <h1>Second Page</h1>
    <p>I get help by asking other people in class to help with things I don't understand and signing up for help from the lab tutor.~</p>
    <p>They are due at 11:59pm, it cannot be turned in late, you can miss up to four before it starts affecting my grade</p>
    <p>They are due at midnight and can be turned in late as long as before 5am the next day.</p>
    <p>We cant use it because it means me and everyone has the same one so I can only use it to view my own webpage and the tutors wont be able to view them.</p>
