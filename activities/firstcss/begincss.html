        <h1>Beginning CSS</h1>
        <p>Inline CSS is when we put the CSS within a opening tag of parts in the main section. Embedded CSS is when we add a style tag and put our CSS in the header that tells what specifically to apply the CSS to. External CSS is when we put all of our CSS in a separate HTML file, highly recommended to put in the same folder that the CSS is being added to.</p>
        <p>We should only be using external CSS because most of the time there are different people working on the webpage so it could make it easier for the programmers because they won't have to worry about overwriting anything on the main html file.</p>
        <p>The selector is used to choose which part of the webpage we want to apply the CSS to.</p>
