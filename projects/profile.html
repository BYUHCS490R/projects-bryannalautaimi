    <h1>Bryanna Lautaimi</h1>
    <p>I am 18 years old &amp; was born in <strong>Salinas, California</strong> on September 26th, 2007. I've lived in the Kingdom of Tonga the majority of my life, but I've been back in forth between there and California. My family and I lived in Talafo'ou, Tongatapu, my mother's hometown but our house was destroyed in the 2018 Cyclone Gita. We finally settled in Nualei, Tongatapu in 2022. I am the second of five kids and am the first to attend college.</p>
    <p>I graduated from <em>Liahona High School</em> in Tonga in 2024. I applied here to BYU—Hawaii right after graduation and got into the Fall 2025 semester. I am now a freshman in my second semester majoring in Information Technology.</p>
