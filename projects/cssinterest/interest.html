        <p>I am a big music lover. Personally cannot go anywhere without listening to music. Everything becomes for fun with music on. My music taste is all over the place, but one genre that I will always come back to is K-Pop. I have been a K-Pop fan since 2020. In my opinion, it is much more fun than other genres because the sound is so diverse and the artists, or what they call "idols", are great performers. It's so fun to be able to listen to a K-Pop song and then be able to watch a performance of the song with it's own choreography. Some of my favorite groups/idols are TWICE, LE SSERAFIM, STAYC, Wendy, and Chuu.</p>
        <p>Besides K-Pop, I love slow, emotional music. Slow pop preferrably. I love sad songs because of all the feelings that aren't only put into the song, but the emotions that I come to feel listening to them. These are songs that I love to karaoke to, as karaoke is one of my few hobbies. I always find time every week to go karaoke at least once. This is the kind of music that I listening to when I am by myself.</p>
