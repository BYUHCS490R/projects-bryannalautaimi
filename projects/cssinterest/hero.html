        <p>Faouzia is a Moroccan Canadian singer and her music is my favorite. I don't know exactly which genre to categorize her music under, but it is my favorite. I discovered her a few years ago but never really kept track of all her releases. But late last year she released a new album and I personally think it's one of the best albums ever. She is underrated but makes really good music. It's emotional, cinematic, and soft but powerful. I read a lot of fantasy-romance books and I love having her music on while I'm reading. It's some of those songs that aplifies the emotions from scenes in the book. Let's just say I feel more immersed in the story when listening to them.</p>
